# jTextEdit
Basic Java based text editor, for experimenting with GUI functions

* The basic file open at the bottom of the GUI runs from the .jar file's current working directory for finding files
* The File-Open menu brings up a jFileChooser that will give a full system to choose files to open
* The histogram updates on every hide/show operation
* The log shows all GUI actions and is updated on every action
